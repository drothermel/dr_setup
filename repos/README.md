# Github Repo Quickstart

By the end this will include:
- Instructions on how to setup a new repo: rye, gitignore, pytest, etc
- Sample starter README with instructions and links to copy
- Sample .gitignore to copy
- Sample `src/__init__.py` to copy
- Sample `tests/starter_test.py` to copy and use to test pytest

Also soon-to-be included here are guides for the common dev libraries that I use:
- rye
- hydra
- wandb
